# icarus
This tool allows us to unenroll devices with device management interception with a proxy and a Certificate Authority  
Clone this repo with `git clone --recursive`

## IMPORTANT NOTICE
DO NOT USE ANY PUBLIC IP ADDRESSES FOR ICARUS AS A PROXY, YOU WILL RISK YOUR DATA and YOU WILL BE REMOTELY COMPROMISED.
ANYTHING GOOGLE CAN REMOTELY PERFORM ON YOUR DEVICE, ICARUS CAN BE USED TO DO. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS INSTALL EXTENSIONS, SPY, USE YOUR CAMERA, REMOTE INTO YOUR DEVICE, GET YOUR PASSWORDS, AND MORE.
ONLY SELF HOST ICARUS, NEVER USE A PUBLIC SERVER!

## New configs what does this mean
These new configs have rolled keys. We are testing the compatibility of these new keys for interception

## Setup and installation instructions
Set up the environment by running the following commands. Make sure to have python3 and python3-venv installed
- `make setup-venv`
- `make enter-venv`
- `make setup-python`
- `make build-packed-data`
- `bash get_original_data.sh`
- `bash make_out.sh myCA.der`

After doing this the output directory will be generated. The output directory that is generated will be used in the shim.
- `bash modify.sh <shim path>`
- Now boot your shim.
- In the terminal of the shim, run `mount /dev/disk/by-label/STATE /mnt/stateful_partition`
- `bash /mnt/stateful_partition/usr/bin/inshim.sh`
- Reboot the device
- Open the network configuration by clicking the lower left button, connecting to wifi, and then change the proxy settings
- Set proxy settings to manual
- Set HTTPS ip to the IP you used to host the proxy server. 
- Resume setup and it will unenroll. 

## Server setup (Only for people hosting servers)
Requirements: npm, node  
run `make start-server`
